📍 **Track**: [Python for Everybody – University of Michigan (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python)

## 🌱 What I Did Today:

- ✅ Completed **"Getting Started with Python"** module
- ✅ Set up Python environment: installed **VS Code** and **Python 3**
- ✅ Chose **Mamba** for managing virtual environments
- ✅ Learned about:
  - Basic **data types**: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
  - Basic **arithmetic operations**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`

## 🔍 Key Concepts Learned:

- Python treats everything as an object—even numbers and strings.
- Type conversion is essential (`int()`, `float()`, `str()`).
- Division can behave differently: `/` gives float, `//` gives integer.
