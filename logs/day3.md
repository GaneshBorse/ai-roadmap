# Day 3 â€“ AI Engineer Journey

**Date:** 2025-05-06  
**Focus:** Python Functions & Built-in Concepts  
**Duration:** ~3 hours

## âœ… What I Learned

- **`def` keyword**: Learned how to define reusable blocks of code (functions) â€” a huge step toward writing cleaner, modular programs.
- **Built-in functions (`min()`, `max()`)**: Interesting discovery â€” lowercase letters are considered greater than uppercase in comparisons (`"a"` > `"Z"`).
- **Type conversions**: Practiced converting between `int`, `float`, and `str`, and understood how type casting affects expressions and outputs.
- **Arguments vs Parameters**: Got a solid grasp on the difference.  
  - *Parameter* = placeholder in function definition   or in simple words "its like a variable that holds value"
  - *Argument* = actual value passed during the call or in simple words "Value we pass"
- **Return values**: Understood how `return` sends data back from a function. Itâ€™s what makes functions truly powerful and reusable.

## ðŸ§  Reflection

Todayâ€™s session made a lot of abstract concepts click. 
Seeing how functions encapsulate logic and return values helped me appreciate the structure behind even simple programs. 
Loving the clarity Python is starting to offer!
